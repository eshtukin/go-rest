# go-rest

1.	Current GitHub repository https://github.com/eshtukin/go-rest is used for Pull Requests monitoring

2.	Twitter account with API access: @goplay25984392

3.  Before running the program you have to define 4 environment variables (which are required for access Twitter dev account via API):

        TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
        TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
        TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
        TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

4.	Credentials for them are not kept in GitHub, and will be provided separately in twitter.env file using template 

        <env variable>=<value>
  
    The quickest way to define env variable on Linux is:
    
        >for line in $(cat twitter.env)
      
    On Windows you can create batch file with 4 rows like this:
    
		    set <env variable>=<value>
        
5.	For Twitter OAuth authorization 3rd party package github.com/mrjones/oauth is used

6.	For symmetry we could use access token authorization on GitHub too (which would allow 5000 requests per hour instead of default 60),       but itâ€™s not implemented yet

7.	You start the program running command

        >go run main.go
        
    The program gathers PRs (either opened after the previous run, or on the first run - all open PRs).
    
8.	The timestamp of current run is kept in the file baseline.txt for future run

9.	Unit tests are yet to be written
